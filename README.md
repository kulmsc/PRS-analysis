# PRS-analysis

This is how I analyze all of the PRSs I made  
All of the scores are within a directory called diseaseFiles  
The phenotypes and files are specificed in phenoDefs and fileDefs  

Then the goSingle.R is used to launch a series of singleFunc.R  
Which then calls compare, pheno, corr in that order  

Not proud of the code organization, but it would be a lot of work  
to start from nothing again.
